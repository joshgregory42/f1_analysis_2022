Analysis of the Formula One Championchip in Python

Utilizing common data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and MatPlotLib. For the telemetry, using the FastF1 package, which can be found [here](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/).

All of the analysis was done using Python 3.9, which is the recommended version (3.10 does not work, although 3.8 does. 3.9 was used due to it being the newest usable version).
